# üö® URGENT: Fix Broken Website Deployment

## Problem
The website at `viralyzaier.netlify.app` is showing broken abstract blue shapes instead of the working application.

## Root Cause
Netlify is deploying from the wrong repository (`Viralyzaier2`) instead of our working repository with Shotstack Studio SDK fixes.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Netlify Repository (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Build & deploy ‚Üí Continuous Deployment
2. Click "Edit settings" next to Git provider
3. Change repository from `Viralyzaier2` to: `copy-of-viralyzaier_-your-ai-video-growth-engine.---2025-08-29T144411.622`
4. Save and trigger new deployment

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
2. Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy manually"
3. Upload the file: `viralyzaier-deployment.zip` (already created)
4. Deploy site

### Option 3: Use Netlify CLI (Advanced)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the dist folder
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

‚úÖ Vite configuration fixed  
‚úÖ PIXI.js compatibility resolved  
‚úÖ Debug tools added
